# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Purpose 

In order to rule out risky loans, different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. This analysis uses imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, data will be undersample the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, the combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
